# 🧾 Donut-Based Invoice OCR Tool

This project is a hybrid **Invoice OCR Automation Tool** that uses advanced document understanding models to extract structured data from invoice documents. The backend is built with **FastAPI**, and the system integrates OCR-free document models like **Donut**, along with hybrid approaches using datasets like **DocVQA** and **CORD-v2** for enhanced accuracy.

---

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Donut (Document Understanding Transformer)** — A transformer-based, OCR-free model developed by Samsung for deep document understanding.
- ❓ **DocVQA (Document Visual Question Answering)** — A benchmark dataset designed to answer questions based on visually rich documents.
- 🧾 **CORD-v2 (Consolidated Receipt Dataset v2)** — An annotated dataset of receipt-style documents that helps train models for key-value and table extraction.

This hybrid architecture provides powerful information extraction from invoices, bypassing traditional OCR limitations.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Create a Conda Environment (Python 3.10)

```bash
conda create -n invoice-env python=3.10
conda activate invoice-env
```

### 2️⃣ Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the FastAPI Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 4️⃣ Open in Browser

Go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

You will see the FastAPI Swagger UI where you can test the API endpoints.

### Run Streamlit for the interactive website

Open another terminal: 

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate invoice-env
```
Run the command:

```bash
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Upload your invoice image** using the `/upload` endpoint.
2. **Wait a few moments** while the Donut model processes the document (especially the first time).
3. **View extracted results** such as:
   - Invoice number
   - Vendor details
   - Line items
   - Totals and taxes
4. Results are shown as structured JSON.
